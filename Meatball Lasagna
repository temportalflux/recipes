# instructions
In a large bowl, mix your mince, breadcrumbs, onion, 50g parmesan, parsley, egg, garlic, chilli flakes and salt. Form even meatballs out of this mix- about 50g each.
Fry your meatballs off in a pan over high heat until nicely browned all over. Remove from heat.
Pour half of your passata into a baking dish, then throw in a layer of meatballs. Top with half of your mozzarella and 50g parmesan. Now go down with your lasagne sheets. Top with the rest of the meatballs, mozzarella and parmesan.
Bake in an oven preheated to 200ºC/390ºF for 40 minutes, or until nicely colored and cooked through.
