Fitting right into October fun is the suitably orange-colored sipper from Sue Thomas. "To serve it in an extra-festive way," she pens from Casa Grande, Arizona, "I'll often put the punch bowl inside a hollowed-out-pumpkin."
20-24 servings

1 can (46 ounces) pineapple juice, divided
1 package (3 ounces) orange gelatin
1 carton (64 ounces) orange juice
1 liter ginger ale, chilled
1 quart orange sherbet

In a saucepan, bring 1 cup of pineapple juice to a boil
Stir in gelatin until dissolved
Cool; transfer to a large pitcher or container
Add orange juice and remaining pineapple juice
Chill
Just before serving, pour into a punch bowl; add ginger ale and mix well
Top with scoops of sherbet.
