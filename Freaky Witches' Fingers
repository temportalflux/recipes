Freaky Witches' Fingers 
http://www.brittablvd.com/Halloween/recipes.html
Yields 5 dozen

1 cup butter, softened
1 cup powdered sugar (=icing sugar; =confectioners sugar)
1 egg
1 tsp almond extract
1 tsp vanilla
2 2/3 cups flour
1 tsp salt
3/4 cup almonds, whole, blanched or sliced
1 tube red decorator gel (optional, not pictured)

In bowl, beat together butter, sugar, egg, almond extract and vanilla.
Beat in flour and salt.
Cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.
Working with one quarter of the dough at a time and keeping remainder refrigerated; roll heaping teaspoonful of dough into finger shape for each cookie.
Squeeze twice along finger length to create knuckle shapes.
Press almond firmly into one end for nail.
After arranging on the lightly greased baking sheets, make slashes with a paring knife across in several places to form knuckles. (Clusters of three slashes for each knuckle looks best)
Bake in 325F oven for 20-25 minutes or until pale golden.
Let cool for 3 minutes.
Lift up almond, squeeze red decorator gel onto nail bed and press almond back in place, so gel oozes out from underneath.
You can also make slashes in the finger and fill them with "blood."
(If you are opting for less gore, you will still need spare icing to glue the almond nails to the cookies after baking, since otherwise they fall off too easily during storage and serving)
When cool enough to stay intact, remove fingers from baking sheets and let cool on racks before storing. Repeat with remaining dough. Baked cookies will keep in an airtight container for at least two weeks. Unbaked mixed dough can be kept refrigerated for at least a week. Arrange for serving attractively on a plate, reaching up out of an urn of chocolate cookie crumb dirt, crawling out of a basket, or your own creative idea.
