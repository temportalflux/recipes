1 cup creamy peanut butter
3/4 cup brown sugar
2 Tbs softened butter
1/2 cup powdered sugar
minature pretzels
1 bag of chocolate chips or Merkins Choc. wafers

Line a baking sheet with wax paper and set aside. In mixing bowl, beat peanut butter and butter until combined. Add sugars and mix well. You should be able to roll mixture into small balls without sticking to your hands. If needed, add more powdered sugar until it is easy to roll. Take each ball and sandwich between two pretzels. Place on wax paper. When done, stick in the freezer for a few minutes. Melt the chocolate (I used Merkins Choc. wafers - easier to work with). Dip each pretzel bite halfway into the chocolate and place on wax paper to set.
