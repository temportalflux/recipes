These little bites are perfect for when you want cookies but don’t want to heat up the house! They’ll keep for a week if stored in an air-tight container in the refrigerator.
32 bites

1 c all-purpose flour
1/8 tsp salt
1 tbsp butter or margarine, melted and cooled
1/4 c unsweetened applesauce
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 c light brown sugar
4 tsp mini semi-sweet chocolate chips

Whisk together the flour and salt in a small bowl. In a medium bowl, stir together the butter, applesauce, and vanilla until thoroughly combined. Mix in the brown sugar, smearing any clumps along the side of the bowl. Add in the dry flour mixture, stirring just until incorporated. Fold in the chocolate chips.
Optional: If the dough is too sticky to shape, refrigerate for 20-40 minutes.
Line a baking sheet or large plate with wax paper. Roll the cookie dough into 32 little balls, using between 1 – 1½ teaspoons of dough in each ball. Place on the wax paper until ready to serve.

Do NOT try to bake these as cookies! They’ll turn out dense and flat because the recipe doesn’t use any baking powder. But stay tuned; I’m working on modifying the recipe for baking too! 
Keep the cookie dough bites stored in the refrigerator. Their flavors meld over time, and they actually taste best after 2 days of sitting in the fridge!
