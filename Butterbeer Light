description|I improved on the well-loved Traditional Hogsmeade-Style Butterbeer recipe, now all the alcohol and calories have been charmed away! Completely sugar-free and alcohol-free!

# ingredients
1|cup|sugar-free butterscotch or English Toffee flavoring syrup (Torani's or similar)
7|cup|diet cream soda (almost one 2 liter bottle)

# instructions
Carefully mix just before serving, adding the butterscotch flavoring to the soda then stirring gently to mix well, or the fizz will dissipate too soon.
To keep butterbeer on hand, pour 1 cup cream soda out of the 2-liter bottle, quickly add 1 cup butterscotch flavoring, and recap the bottle.
