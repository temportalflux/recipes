Serves 6â€“8

36 chocolate sandwich cookies
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
12 ounces white chocolate, melted

In a food processor, finely crush the cookies, reserving about 2 tablespoons of the mixture for sprinkling on top of the truffles.
In a large bowl, combine cookie crumbs and cream cheese, stirring until evenly mixed.
Chill the mixture for about an hour or until the mixture can be rolled into a ball and hold its shape.
Form the mixture into small balls (the size of golf balls).
Dip the truffles in the melted white chocolate and place on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
Sprinkle some of the cookie crumbs on top of the chocolate-coated truffle before the chocolate hardens.
Repeat with the rest of the truffles, reheating the chocolate if necessary.
Serve!
