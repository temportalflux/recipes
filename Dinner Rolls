# ingredients
2 1/2|cup|flour (I use half white, half whole wheat), divided
1|tbsp|sugar
1/2|tsp|salt
2 1/4|tsp|yeast (or one small package)
3/4|cup|warm water
1||egg's worth of egg substitute
2|tbsp|oil
||melted vegan margarine, optional

# instructions
Mix 1 cup flour with the sugar, yeast and salt. Stir in warm water, egg substitute and oil. Beat until smooth (this will be very liquidy). Cover with a hand towel and let rise in a warm place for15 minutes.
Stir in remaining flour and knead for about three minutes on a floured surface. Continue kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic. Divide dough into ~12 rolls and arrange in a greased baking pan or muffin tin.
Cover and let rise another 15-20 min. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Brush tops of rolls with melted margarine, if desired. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until slightly brown.
Using a baking pan will make rolls with soft sides vs. the muffin tin which will make crusty sides.
