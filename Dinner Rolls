12 rolls
45 min

2 1/2 cup flour (I use half white, half whole wheat), divided
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 1/4 teaspoon yeast (or one small package)
3/4 cup warm water
egg substitute to equal 1 egg
2 tablespoons oil
melted vegan margarine, optional

Mix 1 cup flour with the sugar, yeast and salt. Stir in warm water, egg substitute and oil. Beat until smooth (this will be very liquidy). Cover with a hand towel and let rise in a warm place for15 minutes.
Stir in remaining flour and knead for about three minutes on a floured surface. Continue kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic. Divide dough into ~12 rolls and arrange in a greased baking pan or muffin tin.
Cover and let rise another 15-20 min. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Brush tops of rolls with melted margarine, if desired. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until slightly brown.
Using a baking pan will make rolls with soft sides vs. the muffin tin which will make crusty sides. Either one is delicious!
