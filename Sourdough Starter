# instructions
[Day 1]
Mix 1/2 cup of flour with 1/4 cup of water, the consistency should be thick and pasty.
Cover with plastic wrap or a lid, and let it rest in a warm spot, about 75-80 degrees F for 24 hours.
[Day 2]
No action needed, but check to see if the starter has any bubbles. Bubbles indicate fermentation.
[Day 3]
Discard half of the starter.
Add 1/2 cup flour and 1/4 cup water to the remaining half. The texture should resemble thick-ish pancake batter or plain Stonyfield plain yogurt (not Greek) at this point so add more water as needed.
Cover loosely, and let rest in your warm spot for another 24 hours.
[Day 4-6]
Repeat feeding process as with Day 3.
As the yeast begins to develop, your starter will rise, and bubbles will form on the surface and throughout the culture.
When the starter falls, it’s time to feed it again.
[Mature Starter]
When the starter has doubled in size and there are plenty of bubbles (large and small), the starter has likely matured.
You can test if the starter is active by taking a small spoonful and seeing if it floats in water.
Transfer the starter to a new, clean jar.
[Ongoing Care]
Begin by removing and discarding about half of your starter.
Replenish what’s left in the jar with fresh all purpose flour and water.
Cover loosely, and let it rise at room temperature until bubbly and double in size. Once it falls, the bubbles will become frothy and eventually disappear. Then you’ll know it’s time to feed your starter again.
Feed your starter everyday if it’s stored at room temperature (70-80 degrees F). If you keep it in the fridge, feed it once a week.
