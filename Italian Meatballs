[Meatballs]
Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and mix using your hand.
Cook a small test piece, taste for the correct seasoning level, correct seasoning if needed.
Roll meatballs to the size of a large egg, about 3 ounces in weight.
Line a baking sheet with foil, evenly space the meatballs on the sheet.
Set the oven rack to the lower-middle position.
Broil on high and cook the meatballs until browned about 10 minutes.
Turn over and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes.
Add meatballs to the tomato sauce.
Cover, with the lid slightly ajar and simmer on low heat for at least 1 ½ hours, checking and stirring every 20 minutes, or as needed.
Remove the meatballs from the sauce and place into a separate bowl, cover to keep warm.
Mix the sauce; adjust consistency with small amounts of water if too thick.
Taste sauce and adjust with salt and pepper as desired.
Garnish with fresh basil and Parmesan cheese.
