# instructions
Cook spaghetti according to package directions; drain.
Meanwhile, peel the butternut squash and spiralize on a thin noodle setting. Cut any very long strands in half.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a spoon until beginning to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic, sage, and red pepper (if using) and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.
Add the butternut squash and toss to combine. Add the wine and cook, covered, until the squash is just tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
Add the kale and toss to combine. Stir in the cream and mustard and simmer until slightly thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Fold in the cheese.
