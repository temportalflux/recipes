# ingredients
1|cup|Puffed Rice
1/2|cup|Oats
1/2|cup|Pumpkin Seeds
1 1/3|cup|Almonds (roasted)
1/2|cup|Dried Apricot, diced
1/3|cup|Corn Syrup

# instructions
Combine puffed rice, oats, rice, and apricot into a large bowl.
In a sauce pan, heat corn syrup and honey until it reaches 260°F/126°C. Then carefully add vanilla extract and remove from heat.
Immediately pour the honey mixture into the bowl, stir, and transfer it onto a parchment paper–lined baking sheet.
Using a spatula press down the mixture to desired thickness. (Careful - it may still be quite warm!)
Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Heat 1 bar of dark chocolate for 1 minute, then drizzle over the top. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Remove parchment paper and cut into 12 even pieces.
Wrap each bar with wax paper and store up to 1 week.
