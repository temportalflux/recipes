Original Butterbeer 
http://www.brittablvd.com/Halloween/recipes.html
The Traditional Hogsmeade-Style Butterbeer recipe was originally from the Hogwarts Celebrations,  now appearing annually for Halloween by popular demand!
Makes 2 quarts.

1 cup butterscotch schnapps
7 cups cream soda (almost one 2 liter bottle)

Carefully mix just before serving, adding the schnapps to the soda then stirring gently to mix well, or the fizz will dissipate too soon.
To keep butterbeer on hand, pour 1 cup cream soda out of the 2-liter bottle, quickly add 1 cup butterscotch schnapps, and recap the bottle.
I did make a refill batch using 1 cup schnapps to a whole 2 liter bottle of cream soda, which was ratio of 1 to 8, but people tasted the difference and complained, so fair warning!
