description|Whenever I ask my son what flavor of cookie (or ice cream) he’d like, I always gets the same answer – mint Oreo. He also loves cookies (what kid doesn’t?!), so I decided to make these for him. Since the dough is so soft, it’s absolutely necessary to refrigerate the dough. It’s kinda a bummer to have to wait for so long (8-24 hours) before baking the cookies, but the cookies will bake out like crazy otherwise. Even though though they take longer (just because of the chilling time), they are SO worth it!! They are fat and soft and full of rich, cookies-inside-of-a cookie-goodness.

# ingredients
1|cup|butter, at room temperature
1|cup|brown sugar
1/3|cup|granulated sugar
2||large eggs, at room temperature
1|tbsp|vanilla extract
2 1/2|cup|all-purpose flour
1/2|cup|unsweetened cocoa powder
1|tbsp|cornstarch
1 1/2|sp|baking soda
1|tsp|kosher salt
1/2|cup|mint chocolate chips
1|cup|chopped mint Oreos

# instructions
Line 2 cookie sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter and sugars until fluffy well-combined, about 3-4 minutes.
Beat in eggs one at a times, scraping down the sides as needed.
Stir in vanilla until incorporated.
In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt.
Stir in flour mixture until just incorporated.
Stir in chocolate chips and chopped Oreos until combined.
Cover and refrigerate dough at least 3 hours (up to 24 hours). The longer you refrigerate it, the more the dough will hold its shape as it bakes. Ideally, plan for 8-24 hours.
Toward the end of the chilling time, preheat oven to 350 F.
Using a medium cookie scoop, drop scoops of dough onto prepared cookie sheet.
Bake for 8-9 minutes (don’t bake them any longer than 9 minutes).
Remove from oven, and let cool for 5-10 minutes on the cookie sheet.
Transfer to wire rack to finish cooling.
