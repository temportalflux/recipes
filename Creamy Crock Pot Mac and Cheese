1/2|cup|mayonnaise

# instructions
Boil macaroni noodles according to directions to make them very al dente. (I cook them for at least 1 minute less than directed on the bag. Mine boiled for 5 minutes). Drain and rinse under cold water.
Combine all ingredients in the slow cooker and cook on high for 2 hours or low for 3 hours, stirring once or twice.
Serve hot.
